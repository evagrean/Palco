    "Palco" is a web application that provides users with access to
    information about different operas, composers, and and musical periods. Users are able
    to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their
    favorite operas. They can also add a new opera to the list. <br />
    The server-side of the application (server, business logic, business
    layers) consists of a REST API and architected database built using
    JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
